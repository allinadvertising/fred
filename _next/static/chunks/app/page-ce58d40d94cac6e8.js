Your job is to assign keywords to specific URLs in a way that is (1) relevant and (2) prevents keyword cannibalization.\n\n## Input Parameters\n- Target Market (Ahrefs location and language): ".concat(t,'\n- URLs: (see list at bottom)\n\n## Primary Goal\nProduce a keyword-to-URL mapping where each keyword is assigned to exactly one best-fit URL, with high topical relevance and clear intent alignment. For each URL, provide no more than 6 total keywords (1 primary/main keyword and up to 5 closely related halo keywords).\n\n## Non-Negotiable Rules (Hard Constraints)\n1. One keyword maps to one URL only.\n   - You must not assign the same keyword to multiple URLs.\n   - This includes near-duplicates and close variants (singular/plural, word order, minor modifiers) that represent the same query intent.\n2. No random associations.\n   - Do not map a keyword to a URL unless the URL\'s content clearly matches the product/service/topic expressed by the keyword.\n   - Example: “vacuum forming machine” must not be mapped to an “infrared oven” page unless the page is actually about vacuum forming machines.\n3. Intent alignment is mandatory.\n   - Transactional keywords should map to product, collection/category, or service pages (not unrelated informational pages).\n   - Informational keywords should map to guides/blog resources (not pure product pages), unless the page itself is informational.\n4. If two URLs could plausibly target the same keyword, you must pick one “canonical target URL” and select an alternative keyword for the other URL(s).\n5. If the Ahrefs API fails globally (no data returned or repeated outage responses), stop immediately and report: "Ahrefs API is having issues. please try again in 10 minutes".\n6. Per URL, cap the final selection to 6 total keywords: 1 main keyword + up to 5 halo/supporting keywords. If fewer than 6 relevant, non-duplicative keywords pass validation, return only the ones that qualify.\n\n## Required Workflow (Follow in Order)\n### Step 1: Understand each URL before choosing keywords\nFor each URL, infer the page topic and page type using:\n- URL slug and path\n- If accessible in your environment, also use the page title/H1 and primary on-page product/category cues\n\nClassify each URL as one of:\n- Homepage / Brand hub\n- Category / Collection\n- Product / SKU\n- Service page\n- Blog / Resource\n\n### Step 2: Build a candidate keyword set per URL using Ahrefs\nUsing Ahrefs Keywords Explorer (for ').concat(t,"), generate candidates that are tightly related to that URL's topic.\nFor each candidate, collect:\n- Search Volume\n- Keyword Difficulty\n- CPC\n- Parent Topic\n- Intent (Informational, Commercial, Transactional, Navigational)\nStop after selecting one primary keyword and up to five halo keywords per URL that best fit the page topic and intent.\n\n### Step 3: Relevance Validation Gate (must pass to be eligible)\nA keyword can be assigned to a URL only if BOTH are true:\n- Topical match: the keyword describes what the URL is about (product/category/service/topic).\n- SERP sanity check: the typical top-ranking pages for that keyword match the URL's page type or offering (use Ahrefs SERP overview as your check).\n\nIf you cannot reasonably validate relevance, discard the keyword and choose a more accurate alternative.\n\n### Step 4: Global de-duplication and conflict resolution (anti-cannibalization pass)\nAfter generating candidates across all URLs:\n- Create a global list of normalized keywords (treat close variants as duplicates when they share the same intent).\n- If a duplicate appears across multiple URLs, resolve it using these tie-breakers in order:\n  1) Best topical match to the URL's core offering\n  2) Best page-type fit (category for broad head terms; product for highly specific product terms; service page for service terms)\n  3) Most specific relevant page wins over broad pages (avoid mapping non-brand keywords to the homepage unless truly appropriate)\n- Reassign the losing URL(s) to the next-best non-duplicate keyword that still passes the relevance gate.\n- After de-duplication, ensure each URL still has no more than 6 total assigned keywords (1 main + up to 5 halo). Drop the lowest-value options if needed to stay within the cap.\n\n### Step 5: Final output formatting check\nBefore output:\n- Confirm there are zero duplicate keywords across different URLs.\n- Confirm each URL has no more than 6 keyword rows (1 main + up to 5 halo).\n- Confirm every row has all required columns populated (Parent Topic can be blank only if unavailable, but try to include it).\n\n## Output Requirement (Strict)\nReturn ONLY a CSV (no commentary, no markdown) with this exact header and columns:\nURL,Keyword,Search Volume,Keyword Difficulty,CPC,Parent Topic,Intent\n\n").concat(n?"\nURLs:\n".concat(n):"")}},{id:"prompt3",name:"Keyword Scoring & Clustering",instruction:"Score and group keywords in pandas to identify the best main and secondary terms per URL.",build:()=>'# Keyword Analysis, Scoring & Clustering Prompt\n\n**Context:**\nBased on the results of your market investigation, use pandas to filter the attached set of keywords. Look for patterns of all the seed-keywords that fit the core business of my client.\n\n**Instruction:**\nProcess the attached dataset using the following logic to score, cluster, and format the data.\n\n### 1. Scoring Logic\nCalculate a "Keyword Score" for every row to identify the best "Main Keyword" per URL.\n* Intent Score: Map Intent column: Transactional (t)/Commercial (c) = 1.0; Informational (i) = 0.5; Navigational (n) = 0.25; Other = 0.5.\n* Volume Score: log(1 + Volume) / max(log(1 + Volume)) (Logarithmic normalization).\n* Difficulty Score: 1 - (Difficulty / 100) (Inverse difficulty; lower is better).\n* CPC Score: Cap at 90th percentile (P90), then calculate CPC / P90.\n* Final Formula:\n    Score = (Intent x 0.35) + (Volume x 0.30) + (Difficulty x 0.25) + (CPC x 0.10)\n\n### 2. Grouping Logic\n* Group by URL: Aggregate all keywords belonging to the same URL.\n* Identify Main Keyword: The keyword with the highest "Keyword Score" in the group becomes the Keyword (Main).\n* Identify Secondary Keywords: All other keywords for that URL become Keyword_n. Sort them by "Keyword Score" descending.\n\n---\n\n### Output format (VERY IMPORTANT)\n\nYour final answer must be a valid CSV ONLY, with no explanations, commentary, or extra text.\n\nThe first row MUST be the header row, exactly as follows:\n\nURL,Keyword,Volume,Difficulty,Keyword_1,Volume_1,Difficulty_1,Keyword_2,Volume_2,Difficulty_2,Keyword_3,Volume_3,Difficulty_3,Keyword_4,Volume_4,Difficulty_4,Keyword_5,Volume_5,Difficulty_5\n\n* If the data contains more than 5 secondary keywords per row, extend this pattern to Keyword_6,Volume_6,Difficulty_6, etc., up to 8 secondary keywords.\n* If fewer secondary keywords exist for a row, leave the unused fields blank.\n\nEach subsequent row should represent one unique URL, structured as:\n\n1. URL\n2. Keyword (Main Keyword)\n3. Volume (Main Keyword)\n4. Difficulty (Main Keyword)\n5. Keyword_1 (Highest scoring secondary keyword)\n6. Volume_1\n7. Difficulty_1\n8. Keyword_2\n9. Volume_2\n10. Difficulty_2\n11. continuing up to Keyword_n,Volume_n,Difficulty_n\n\n### Data handling rules\n\n* Do NOT change the original keyword text except to trim whitespace.\n* Do NOT fabricate any values (volume, difficulty, or keywords). Only use what is present in the CSV.\n* If a main keyword has no secondary keywords, still output the row with the primary four fields filled (URL, Keyword, Volume, Difficulty) and leave all Keyword_n fields blank.\n* Use a comma as the CSV delimiter and escape any commas inside text values as needed.\n\n### Final requirement\n\nReturn ONLY the final consolidated CSV (header + rows) following the structure above, with no additional explanation or formatting.'}],s=e=>o.map(t=>({id:t.id,name:t.name,instruction:t.instruction,content:t.build(e)})),l=["clientName","clientUrl","targetMarket","keywordUrls"],c={clientName:"",clientUrl:"",businessType:"",knownProducts:"",focus:"",targetMarket:"",keywordUrls:""},d=[{key:"clientName",label:"Client name",placeholder:"Acme Corp",required:!0},{key:"clientUrl",label:"Client URL (starting point)",placeholder:"https://example.com",required:!0},{key:"targetMarket",label:"Target market for Ahrefs extraction",placeholder:"Canada, USA, UK, etc.",required:!0,helper:"Used in the Ahrefs keyword extraction prompt."},{key:"keywordUrls",label:"List of URLs for keyword research",placeholder:"https://example.com/page-1\nhttps://example.com/page-2",helper:"Required.
